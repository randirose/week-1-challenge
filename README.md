# Code Refactor Starter Code - Week 1 Challenge

## Description

Provided with starter code, we were asked to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards and optimize the code for search engines. I was able to practice multiple useful aspects of improving (refactoring) code, including:
- using semantic HTML elements
- organizing heading attribute
- adding alt tags to images
- commenting HTML and css files to add notes and structure


## Usage

You can visit the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/randirose/week-1-challenge, and the live URL on GitHub Pages here: https://randirose.github.io/week-1-challenge

See screenshot of what live page should look like below:
