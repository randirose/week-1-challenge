# Code Refactor - Week 1 Challenge

## User Story

AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title  

## Description

Provided with starter code, we were asked to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards and optimize the code for search engines. I was able to practice multiple useful aspects of improving (refactoring) code, including:
- using semantic HTML elements
- organizing heading attribute
- adding alt tags to images
- commenting HTML and css files to add notes and structure
